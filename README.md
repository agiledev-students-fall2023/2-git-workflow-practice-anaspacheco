**Opinion:** https://www.simplethread.com/20-things-ive-learned-in-my-20-years-as-a-software-engineer/ 

**Thoughts:** While I am usually not a huge fan of these kinds of articles (especially because they are usually infused with clichés), I found this one to be actually very realistic and useful. A few highlights are his comments about the significance of having a good grasp of what is possible to develop, and his advice for developers to think deeply about the user experience of their software is at all times. 

**Lara Kim Edit:** I also found this an interesting article to read, because as an aspiring software engineer, I was able to read about an expert in the field. I especially resonated with #1 on the list, where the author wrote that he "still do[esn't] know very much," because I also feel as though in this field, there's an endless amount of new things to be learned. I often feel behind others or clueless. However, the article helped me gain more optimism. Thanks for sharing!
